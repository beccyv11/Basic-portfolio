        <p>I am a San Francisco native currently working in the fashion tech industry. I work for Rent the Runway as a Store Experience Lead where my focus is to enhance both the customer experience and the employee experience. I have been in management now for 5 years and continue to develop my abilities as a leader. I am working to double our current team size in an effort to effectively open our new flagship location. I am spearheading retail learning and development in our store throughout this growth process. </p>
                
        <p>While working for a tech based company, I have grown an interest in the development of our retail systems. I plan to use my full stack development skill set to enhance our current retail systems in order to better our customers interaction with technology. </p>
                
        <p>I have also been deeply involved in athletics most of my life and you can still find me both on the soccer field or at the boxing gym. I plan to continue building my own website to share resources to all types of athletes. </p>
